# Learn ML in Java

## Installation

This project does not require any installation. It is a web-based learning platform that can be accessed through a web browser.

## Usage

The website is divided into two main sections: ML Theory and ML Practice. Users can navigate to the desired section by clicking on the corresponding button on the homepage.

The ML Theory section covers the theoretical concepts of machine learning, such as neural networks, Bernoulli distribution, and linear algebra. The ML Practice section focuses on coding machine learning algorithms from scratch in Java, including topics like tokenization, autoregressive models, deep learning, and more.

The website is designed to be self-paced, with code examples, practice exercises, and the ability to download source files for further exploration.
